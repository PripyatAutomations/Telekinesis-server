Right now this is still a bit of a mess...

* Install needed packages
	make deps

* Edit sql/users.sql to define an admin user

* Edit etc/netrig.yaml to configure everything else

* Regenerate everthing
	make world

* Install (optional)-- you probably shouldnt do this unless cloned somewhere besdies /opt/netrig 
	make install PREFIX=/opt/netrig

* Start it (local) at least once to build everything...
	make start

* Start it (if installed and not using init)
	make -C /opt/netrig start

---------------------------

All users, databases, etc will be autogenerated.

Much cleanup is needed... Feel free to contribute!
